        text_1: Panel 1 (Top panel, single text box): 
        A manager is standing at the head of a meeting table, with a serious expression, addressing three people seated. The first text box is for what the manager is saying to introduce the topic or issue in the meeting.

        text_2: Panel 2 (Middle panel, three text boxes): 
        This panel shows the three seated people responding to the manager's statement from Panel 1:
            - First text box (left): The first person seated, raising a finger confidently, making a suggestion or giving an answer.
            - Second text box (middle): The second person, who is agreeing or adding something supportive to the first person's statement.
            - Third text box (right): The third person, leaning back casually, provides a comically unhelpful or absurd suggestion.

        text_3: Panel 3 (Lower left panel, no text box): 
        The manager looks visibly angry or frustrated after hearing the third person's response from the middle panel.

        text_4: Panel 4 (Lower right panel, no text box): 
        The third person who gave the absurd response is now being thrown out of the office building window. This is the visual punchline of the meme.

        In summary, the meme typically follows the structure of a serious situation, followed by escalating responses that culminate in a ridiculous or inappropriate suggestion that leads to the person being ejected from the meeting.""",
